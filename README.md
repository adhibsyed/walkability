**Dissertation Title: Modelling Urban Visual Walkability of Leicester with Street View Images Using Deep Learning and Unsupervised Learning Techniques**

This repository contains the materials used for my dissertation project, which involved the development of a visual walkability index and classification for Leicester utilising Google Street View Images. The Street View Images used for the project are not published, but the materials contain data derived from the images (Contains Google Street View data © Google © 2023).

An **interactive map** illustrating the clusters and the pen portraits is availalable on a R shiny dashboard available here: https://adhibsyed.shinyapps.io/walkabilitydashboard/
